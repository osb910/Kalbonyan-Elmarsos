1. Write a function called 'describeCountry' which takes three parameters: 'country', 'population' and 'capitalCity'. Based on this input, the function returns a string with this format: 'Finland has 6 million people and its capital city is Helsinki'

// Assignment #2 Function Declarations vs. Expressions
/**
1. The world population is 7900 million people. Create a function declaration called percentageOfWorld1' which receives a 'population' value, and returns the percentage of the world population that the given population represents. For example, China has 1441 million people, so it's about 18.2% of the world population
2. To calculate the percentage, divide the given 'population' value by 7900 and then multiply by 100
3. Call 'percentageOfWorld1' for 3 populations of countries of your choice, store the results into variables, and log them to the console
4. Create a function expression which does the exact same thing, called 'percentageOfWorld2', and also call it with 3 country populations (can be the same populations)

3. Unfortunately, after some time, the new country is dissolved. So remove it from the end of the array
4. If the 'neighbours' array does not include the country â€˜Germanyâ€™, log to the console: 'Probably not a central European country :D'
5. Change the name of one of your neighbouring countries. To do that, find the index of the country in the 'neighbours' array, and then use that index to change the array at that index position. For example, you can search for 'Sweden' in the array, and then replace it with 'Republic of Sweden'.

3. Add a method called 'checkIsland' to the 'myCountry' object. This method will set a new property on the object, called 'isIsland'. 'isIsland' will be true if there are no neighbouring countries, and false if there are. Use the ternary operator to set the property.
